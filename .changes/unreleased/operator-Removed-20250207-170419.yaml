project: operator
kind: Removed
body: |-
  Removed bundled FluxCD controllers, bundled FluxCD CRDs, and support for delegating control to FluxCD.

    Previously reconciled FluxCD resources (`HelmRepository`, `HelmRelease`)
    will **NOT** be garbage collected upon upgrading. If the operator is
    coexisting with a FluxCD installation, please take care to manually remove
    the left over resources.

    `chartRef.useFlux: true` and `chartRef.chartVersion` are no longer
    supported. The controller will log errors and abort reconcilation until the
    fields are unset. Ensure that both have been removed from all `Redpanda`
    resources before upgrading.

    All other `chartRef` fields are deprecated and are no longer referenced.

    `helmRelease`, `helmReleaseReady`, `helmRepository`, `helmRepositoryReady`,
    and `upgradeFailures` are no longer set on `RedpandaStatus`, similar to their
    behavior when `useFlux: false` was set.
