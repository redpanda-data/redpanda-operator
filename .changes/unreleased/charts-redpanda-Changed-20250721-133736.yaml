    Cluster configuration syncing now sends the entire config instead of a minimal patch

      Due to numerous divergences in how the operator, redpanda and their
      respective underlying YAML serde libraries handle marshalling data, computing
      a minimal diff has generally resulted in nasty bugs not worth the few bytes
      and CPU cycles we were initially trying to save.
