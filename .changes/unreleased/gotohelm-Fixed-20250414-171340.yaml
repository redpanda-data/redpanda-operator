    Actually implement `fromYaml` (It was previously the same as `toYaml`).

      GoToHelm's implementation of `fromYaml` adds a wrapper around `fromYaml` that
      will `panic` if unmarshalling fails. This is done to avoid undefined behavior
      as helm's implementation returns an object containing the error; which can't
      be implemented in go in an ergonomic fashion.
