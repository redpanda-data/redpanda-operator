kind: Changed
body: |-
    `clusterDomain` now defaults to `cluster.local.` (A trialing `.` has been added) and the chart no longer adds trailing `.`'s to internal domains.

      For users not experiencing issues with trailing `.`'s this change has no
      effect. For users that have had issues with trailing `.`'s, it's now possible
      to opt-out of this behavior by explicitly setting `clusterDomain` to `cluster.local`.

      For users that override `clusterDomain`, copied a previous releases
      values.yaml, or use the `--reuse-values` flag, trailing `.`'s will be tripped
      from domains upon updating. This behavior may be opted into by appending a
      `.` to `clusterDomain` prior to upgrading.
