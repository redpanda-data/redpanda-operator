kind: Removed
body: |-
    `statefulset.securityContext`, `statefulset.sideCars.configWatcher.securityContext` have been removed.

      These fields previously served as both PodSecurityContext and SecurityContext
      across the entire chart which led to confusing semantics that couldn't be
      fixed without breaking backwards compatiblity.

      The top level `podTemplate` field may be used to control
      PodSecurityContexts and SecurityContexts across the chart.
