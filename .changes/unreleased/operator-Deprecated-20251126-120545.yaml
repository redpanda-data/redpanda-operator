kind: Deprecated
body: The entirety of the `spec.clusterSpec.console` block in the Redpanda CR is now deprecated and will be removed in the future. Any Redpanda CR that contains one will automatically be migrated to a standalone Console CR with a back reference to the parent Redpanda CR. Note that these will *not* be automatically deleted when the `console` stanza is removed or when the parent Redpanda CR is deleted.
