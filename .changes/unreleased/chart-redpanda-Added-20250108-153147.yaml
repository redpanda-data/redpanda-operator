body: |
  Added `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` as an alternative method of managing the redpanda container's resources.

    When both `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` are specified, the
    redpanda container's `resources` will be set to the provided values and all
    other keys of `resources` will be ignored. Instead, all other values will be
    inferred from the limits and requests.

    This allows fine grain control of resources. i.e. It is now possible to set
    CPU requests without setting limits:

    ```yaml
    resources:
    limits: {} # Specified but no cpu or memory values provided
    requests:
      cpu: 5 # Only CPU requests
    ```

    For more details see [redpanda's values.yaml](./charts/redpanda/values.yaml).
