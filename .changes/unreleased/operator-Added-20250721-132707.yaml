    Annotations that function like Feature Flags will now have their default values added to Custom Resources, if they are not already present.

      This behavior is present to alert users of what feature flags exist, what
      their default values are, and to make it easier to toggle between values. For
      example, `Redpanda`'s will have `operator.redpanda.com/config-sync-mode:
      additive` added as an annotation.
