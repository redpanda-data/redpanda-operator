project: operator
kind: Changed
body: |-
    The v2 operator now uses a templated bootstrap.yaml file, like v1.

    For the 2.3.* release only, the statefulset.initContainers.configurator.additionalCLIArgs entry on the CR is *not* populated by the operator; this must be done manually to resolve external secrets.
