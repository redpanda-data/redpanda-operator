    Removed both the node-watcher and "old" decommissioner controllers which were enabled by the `--additional-controllers` flag.

      The `--additional-controllers` flag is still accepted by the CLI but is no longer used.

      These controllers have been replaced by the pvcunbinder and decommissioner controllers, respectively.
