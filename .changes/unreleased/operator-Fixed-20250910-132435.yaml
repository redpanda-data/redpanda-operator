body: 'Fix a bug with the way the config-watcher sidecar syncs users. The Kubernetes mechanism for writing out a changed secret is involves re-creating a symlink in the secrets directory that points to the mounted secret. Previously the config-watcher only detected changes to the entire directory and could potentially miss syncs, this resyncs everything anytime the symlink is recreated. '
