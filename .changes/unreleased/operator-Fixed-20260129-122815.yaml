project: operator
kind: Fixed
body: In previous versions of the operator a field manager was unknowingly changed for resources that were synchronized via server-side apply. This can cause problems with modifying fields such as Service and StatefulSet port definitions. A post-upgrade migration job was added to remove any unwanted field managers.
