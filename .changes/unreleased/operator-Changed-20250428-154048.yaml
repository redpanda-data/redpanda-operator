    The operator will now populate `.Statefulset.SideCars.Image`, if unspecified, with it's own image.

      The image and tag may be controlled with pre-existing
      `--configurator-base-image` and `--configurator-tag` flags, respectively.

      The previous behavior was to defer to the default of the redpanda chart which
      could result in out of sync RBAC requirements or regressions of
      sidecar/initcontainer behavior, if using an older redpanda chart.
