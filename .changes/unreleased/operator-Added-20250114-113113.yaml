  Users in air-gapped environments that cannot access the official Redpanda Helm Chart repository (`https://charts.redpanda.com/`)
    can now specify an alternative Helm chart repository using the `helm-repository-url` flag. In the Redpanda Operator Helm chart,
    this flag is not exposed as an option in the Helm values. Instead, it must be set as an input in the `additionalCmdFlags` array.
    
    The given repository must include the following charts:
    * Redpanda
    * Console
    * Connectors
