    `podTemplate`, `statefulset.podTemplate`, and `post_install_job.podTemplate` may now contain template expressions **with in string fields**

      To compensate for some of the functionality that was lost with the removal of
      fields like `extraVolumes`, we've upgraded `podTemplate` fields to support
      templating. Rather than allowing full control over a structured value, we've
      reduced the scope to only string fields. This is significantly more
      maintainable and less error prone.

      As an example, the below snippet will apply the release name as an annotation
      to all Pods created by the chart.

      ```yaml
      podTemplate:
        annotations:
          "keys-cannot-be-templated": '{{ .Release.Name }}' # But values can!
      ```

      See `values.yaml` for additional examples.
