    Usage of `tpl` and `include` now function as expected when `useFlux: false` is set.

      `{{ (get (fromJson (include "redpanda.Fullname" (dict "a" (list .)))) "r") }}` would previously failure with fairly arcane errors.

      Now, the above example will correctly render to a string value. However,
      syntax errors and the like are still reported in an arcane fashion.
