    `rpk debug bundle --namespace $NAMESPACE` now works by default.

      The chart now creates a set of `Roles` and `RoleBindings` that satisfy the
      requirements of running `rpk debug bundle` from any redpanda Pod. These
      permissions may be disabled by specifying `rbac.rpkDebugBundle=false`.

      Additionally, the redpanda container now always has a Kubernetes
      ServiceAccount token mounted to it to ensure `rpk debug bundle` can be
      executed successfully.
