project: operator
kind: Fixed
body: |-
    The operator now unconditionally produces statefulsets that have environment variables available to the initContainer that are used for CEL-based config patching.

    Previously it attempted to leave existing sts resources unpatched if it seemed like they had already been bootstrapped. With the adoption of CEL patching for node configuration, that left sts pods unable to restart.
