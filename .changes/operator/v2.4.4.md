## v2.4.4 - 2025-07-15
### Added
* Add `no-set-superusers` flag to sidecar command to give option for operator base deployment to reconcile superuser list only in operator.
### Changed
* Bump helm chart dependency to 5.10.3
* Operator now reconciles superusers from Kubernetes Secret and adds bootstrap user to the list.
* The v2 operator now uses a templated bootstrap.yaml file, like v1.

    For the 2.4.* release only, the statefulset.initContainers.configurator.additionalCLIArgs entry on the CR is *not* populated by the operator; this must be done manually to resolve external secrets.
### Fixed
* Setting of the `superuser` cluster configuration is now solely controlled by the operator and now correctly includes the `kubernetes-controller` bootstrap user.
