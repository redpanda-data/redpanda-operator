## v2.3.7-24.3.6 - 2025-02-28
### Changed
* Bumped internal redpanda chart to  v5.9.20.
  `chartRef` now defaults to v5.9.20.
  When `useFlux` is `false`, the equivalent of chart v5.9.20 will be deployed.

### Removed
* `gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy` container is deprecated and has been removed from the Redpanda
operator helm chart. The same ports will continue to serve metrics using kubebuilder's built in RBAC.

Any existing prometheus rules don't need to be adjusted.

For more details see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/discussions/3907

### Fixed
* Usage of `tpl` and `include` now function as expected when `useFlux: false` is set.

  `{{ (get (fromJson (include "redpanda.Fullname" (dict "a" (list .)))) "r") }}` would previously failure with fairly arcane errors.

  Now, the above example will correctly render to a string value. However,
  syntax errors and the like are still reported in an arcane fashion.

* Toggling `useFlux`, in either direction, no longer causes the bootstrap user's password to be regenerated.

  Manual mitigation steps are available [here](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/issues/1596#issuecomment-2628356953).
* Reverse order of applying resources to first create ClusterRole and then ClusterRoleBinding.
  When Redpanda custom resource has enabled RBAC the reconciliation was blocked due
  ClusterRoleBinding referencing not yet created ClusterRole.
