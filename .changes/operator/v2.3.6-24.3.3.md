## v2.3.6-24.3.3 - 2025-01-17
### Added
* Users in air-gapped environments that cannot access the official Redpanda Helm Chart repository (`https://charts.redpanda.com/`)
  can now specify an alternative Helm chart repository using the `helm-repository-url` flag. In the Redpanda Operator Helm chart,
  this flag is not exposed as an option in the Helm values. Instead, it must be set as an input in the `additionalCmdFlags` array.
  
  The given repository must include the following charts:
  * Redpanda
  * Console
  * Connectors

* Added `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` as an alternative method of managing the redpanda container's resources.

  When both `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` are specified, the
  redpanda container's `resources` will be set to the provided values and all
  other keys of `resources` will be ignored. Instead, all other values will be
  inferred from the limits and requests.

  This allows fine grain control of resources. i.e. It is now possible to set
  CPU requests without setting limits:

  ```yaml
  resources:
    limits: {} # Specified but no cpu or memory values provided
    requests:
      cpu: 5 # Only CPU requests
  ```

### Changed
* For any user that is mirroring configurator image (air-gapped environment) and changes entrypoint
  or wraps configurator with additional script the following constraint need to be meet:
  * set the following flags
    * to change the container repository set `--configurator-base-image=my.repo.com/configurator` flag
    * to change the container tag set `--configurator-tag=XYZ` flag
  * image needs to supports the entrypoint `redpanda-operator configure` as it is the default one

### Fixed
* Value's merging no longer writes files to disk which prevents the operator from eating disk space when the reconciliation loop is run in rapid succession
* Fixed slice out of bounds panics when using the fs-validator and `useFlux: false`
