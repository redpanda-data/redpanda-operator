## [v25.1.4](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/releases/tag/operator%2Fv25.1.4) - 2025-11-05
### Changed
* Client certificates are now named `$FULLNAME-$CERT-client-cert`.
* Bump Redapnda helm chart go dependency to 5.10.5
### Fixed
* Scaling down a cluster when the controller leader is one of the Brokers to be decommissioned now works as expected.
* Fix a bug with the way the config-watcher sidecar syncs users. The Kubernetes mechanism for writing out a changed secret is involves re-creating a symlink in the secrets directory that points to the mounted secret. Previously the config-watcher only detected changes to the entire directory and could potentially miss syncs, this resyncs everything anytime the symlink is recreated.
* `spec.clusterSpec.initContainerImage` is not longer incorrectly set to the redpanda image.
* mTLS client certificates are now generated per certificate, as required, instead of using a single and potentially invalid certificate.
