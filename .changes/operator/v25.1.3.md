## [v25.1.3](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/releases/tag/operator%2Fv25.1.3) - 2025-08-07
### Fixed
* Fixed hanging of helm installations that set `--wait` and `--set crds.enabled=true`.

    The CRD installation job now runs as a preinstall/preupgrade hook and has
    been given dedicated RBAC resources.
