## v2.3.12-24.3.17 - 2025-07-08
### Changed
* The operator will try stripping off a layer of quotation from configuration values when interpreting numeric and boolean values. These may be accidentally introduced upstream of the CR, but where the intent is obvious we don't need to be strict about it.
### Fixed
* Added the missing `https` port to the operator Pod that was referenced by the [`ServiceMonitor`](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/blob/4e34c5ea79b00fa0caeda64955e3291666194274/operator/chart/servicemonitor.go#L42)
* Empty Redpanda specs (i.e. `clusterSpec: null` or otherwise unspecified) no longer causes the operator to panic
* `get` permissions on `Node` resources is now correctly configured by default.

   `--set rbac.createAdditionalControllerCRs=true` is no longer required for rackawareness to work.
* Crashes from the Sidecar container (e.g. due to a temporary API Server outage) no longer forcefully restart the redpanda container.
