## v2.3.11-24.3.14 - 2025-05-27
### Changed
* Bump helm chart dependency to 5.9.23
* The v2 operator now uses a templated bootstrap.yaml file, like v1.

For the 2.3.* release only, the statefulset.initContainers.configurator.additionalCLIArgs entry on the CR is *not* populated by the operator; this must be done manually to resolve external secrets.
### Fixed
* updated operator v1 to ignore "cluster.redpanda.com/node-pool-spec" annotation for pod rolls. previously, under certain conditions, the operator started rolling pods if this annotation changed - but there is no need to do so.
