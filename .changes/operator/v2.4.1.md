## v2.4.1 - 2025-04-08
### Added
* Added scheduled sync of ghost broker decommissioner to ensure it's running, even if no watches trigger the reconciler.
### Changed
* Reconciliation will attempt to create all resources regardless of errors encounter.
  All errors will be reported at the end of the reconciliation loop.

* [Chart] Moved all template rendering into `entry-point.yaml` to match the redpanda and console charts.
* The redpanda operator's helm chart has been merged into the operator itself.

  Going forward the chart's `version` and `appVersion` will always be equal.
* The `useFlux` field now defaults to `false`
* The `chartRef.useFlux: false` configuration, is now considered stable.
* The `chartVersion` field supports only charts within the `v5.9.x` and `v5.10.x` series. Pre-existing Redpanda resources with an older version should be upgraded before upgrading the operator.
### Fixed
* Reverse order of applying resources to first create ClusterRole and then ClusterRoleBinding.
  When Redpanda custom resource has enabled RBAC the reconciliation was blocked due
  ClusterRoleBinding referencing not yet created ClusterRole.

* Certificate reloading for webhook and metrics endpoints should now behave correctly.
