## v2.3.15-24.3.18 - 2025-11-22
### Changed
* Bump Redpanda helm chart dependency to 5.9.29
### Fixed
* `ClusterRole`s for the PVCUnbinder and BrokerDecommissioner are now enabled / disabled when their respective controller is enabled / disabled.

  Previously `ClusterRole`s were always generated and could only be disabled by setting `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.createRBAC` to `false` which rendered the sidecar inoperable.
