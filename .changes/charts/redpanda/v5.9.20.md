## v5.9.20 - 2025-02-06
### Changed
* Attempted lookups of the bootstrap user's existing password are no longer gated by `.Release.IsUpgrade`.

  This is unlikely to affect existing workflows as `Lookup` is likely stubbed
  out in situations where `.Release.IsUpgrade` is incorrectly set. i.e. `helm
  template`.
