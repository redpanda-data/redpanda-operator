## v5.9.22 - 2025-05-01
### Changed
* `serviceAccount.create` now defaults to `true`.

  The previous behavior resulted in using the `default` service account and
  extending it with all bindings generated from the chart. Such behavior is
  unlikely to be desired.
* `rpk debug bundle --namespace $NAMESPACE` now works by default.

  The chart now creates a set of `Roles` and `RoleBindings` that satisfy the
  requirements of running `rpk debug bundle` from any redpanda Pod. These
  permissions may be disabled by specifying `rbac.rpkDebugBundle=false`.

  Additionally, the redpanda container now always has a Kubernetes
  ServiceAccount token mounted to it to ensure `rpk debug bundle` can be
  executed successfully.
### Fixed
* Fixed an issue where not explicitly specifying a SASL auth mechanism when SASL is enabled caused Console to fail to start up.
* Prevent broker nodes from restarting when solely the cluster replica amount changes
* Fixed rack awareness by mounting a service account token to the initcontainer when rack awareness is enabled.
* Broken `Issuer`s and `Certificate`s are no longer needlessly generated when `tls.<cert>.issuerRef` is provided.
* The `schema_registry_client` and `pandaproxy_client` stanzas of `redpanda.yaml`
  now respect `listeners.kafka.tls.trustStore`, when provided.
