## v5.10.5 - 2025-11-05
### Changed
* Client certificates are now named `$FULLNAME-$CERT-client-cert`.
* Bump Redpanda version in helm chart metadata and appVersion to `v25.1.12`.
* Bump Redpanda operator sidecar container tag to 2.4.5
### Fixed
* `ClusterRole`s for the PVCUnbinder and BrokerDecommissioner are now enabled / disabled when their respective controller is enabled / disabled.

  Previously `ClusterRole`s were always generated and could only be disabled by setting `.statefulset.sideCars.controllers.createRBAC=false` which rendered the sidecar inoperable.
* `statefulset.podTemplate.spec.volumes` can now be used to override chart generated volumes.
* Fix a bug with the way the config-watcher sidecar syncs users. The Kubernetes mechanism for writing out a changed secret is involves re-creating a symlink in the secrets directory that points to the mounted secret. Previously the config-watcher only detected changes to the entire directory and could potentially miss syncs, this resyncs everything anytime the symlink is recreated. 
* mTLS client certificates are now generated per certificate, as required, instead of using a single and potentially invalid certificate.
