## v5.9.21 - 2025-03-03
### Changed
* Promoted the config-watcher sidecar into a real go binary that handles user management and simplifies cluster health checks so they no longer fail when the sole issue is that other nodes in the cluster are unavailable. Additionally the new sidecar subsumes the behavior of the `statefulset.sideCars.controllers` stanza which should now be specified via their own `enabled` flags.
* `clusterDomain` now defaults to `cluster.local.` (A trialing `.` has been added) and the chart no longer adds trailing `.`'s to internal domains.

  For users not experiencing issues with trailing `.`'s this change has no
  effect. For users that have had issues with trailing `.`'s, it's now possible
  to opt-out of this behavior by explicitly setting `clusterDomain` to `cluster.local`.

  For users that override `clusterDomain`, copied a previous releases
  values.yaml, or use the `--reuse-values` flag, trailing `.`'s will be tripped
  from domains upon updating. This behavior may be opted into by appending a
  `.` to `clusterDomain` prior to upgrading.
* Bump AppVersion to v24.3.6 Redpanda release
* Bump Redpanda operator side car container tag to `v2.3.7-24.3.6`.
### Fixed
* Reverse order of applying resources to first create ClusterRole and then ClusterRoleBinding.
  When Redpanda custom resource has enabled RBAC the reconciliation was blocked due
  ClusterRoleBinding referencing not yet created ClusterRole.
