## v5.9.30 - 2025-12-01
### Changed
* Bump Redpanda operator sidecar container tag to `v2.3.15-24.3.18`.
### Deprecated
* - `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.createRBAC` is deprecated and no longer respected. In most cases, setting this field to `false` would result in a broken deployment. RBAC may be controlled via `rbac.enabled` or per controller via `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.{pvcUnbinder,brokerDecommissioner}.enabled`.
* `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.run` has been unused for many releases and is now deprecated. Individual controllers may be enabled/disabled by setting their enabled field: `statefulset.sideCars.pvcUnbinder.enabled`, `statefulset.sideCars.brokerDecommissioner.enabled`.
