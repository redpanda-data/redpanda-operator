## v5.9.25 - 2025-06-27
### Changed
* Bumped `appVersion` to v24.3.16.
* The generated bootstrap user password secret is now immutable. It was always intended to be a single-time generation, and now that is enforced at the Kubernetes API layer.
### Removed
* Removed regex validation of all image tags.
### Fixed
* Corrected naming of `Role`s to use Fullname instead of Name, which ensures they are unique within their namespace.
* Updated naming of `ClusterRole`s to include the release namespace. This ensures that they are unique per release and permits installing the chart with the same name across different namespaces.
