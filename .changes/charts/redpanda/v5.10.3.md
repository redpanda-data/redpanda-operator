## v5.10.3 - 2025-07-10
### Changed
* The generated bootstrap user password secret is now immutable. It was always intended to be a single-time generation, and now that is enforced at the Kubernetes API layer.
* Bump Redpanda operator side car container tag to `v2.4.3`.
* Bump Redpanda version in helm chart metadata and appVersion to `v25.1.7`.
### Removed
* The unrespected`kafkaEndpoint` listener parameter has been removed from `values.yaml`
### Fixed
* `authentication_method` is no longer set on `http_api` as redpanda itself does not support authentication on the http API.
* Corrected naming of `Role`s to use Fullname instead of Name, which ensures they are unique within their namespace.
* Updated naming of `ClusterRole`s to include the release namespace. This ensures that they are unique per release and permits installing the chart with the same name across different namespaces.
* Crashes from the Sidecar container (e.g. due to a temporary API Server outage) no longer forcefully restart the redpanda container.
