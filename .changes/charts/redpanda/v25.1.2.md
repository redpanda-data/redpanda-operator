## [v25.1.2](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/releases/tag/charts%2Fredpanda%2Fv25.1.2) - 2025-11-05
### Changed
* Client certificates are now named `$FULLNAME-$CERT-client-cert`.
* Bump Redpanda operator side car container tag to `v25.1.3`.
* Bump Redpanda default version to `v25.1.12`.
### Fixed
* `statefulset.podTemplate.spec.volumes` can now be used to override chart generated volumes.
* Fix a bug with the way the config-watcher sidecar syncs users. The Kubernetes mechanism for writing out a changed secret is involves re-creating a symlink in the secrets directory that points to the mounted secret. Previously the config-watcher only detected changes to the entire directory and could potentially miss syncs, this resyncs everything anytime the symlink is recreated. 
* mTLS client certificates are now generated per certificate, as required, instead of using a single and potentially invalid certificate.
