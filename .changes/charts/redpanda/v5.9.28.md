## v5.9.28 - 2025-07-18
### Changed
* Bump appVersion version to `v24.3.18`.
### Fixed
* `ClusterRole`s for the PVCUnbinder and BrokerDecommissioner are now enabled / disabled when their respective controller is enabled / disabled.

  Previously `ClusterRole`s were always generated and could only be disabled by setting `.statefulset.sideCars.controllers.createRBAC=false` which rendered the sidecar inoperable.
