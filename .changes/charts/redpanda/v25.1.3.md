## [v25.1.3](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/releases/tag/charts%2Fredpanda%2Fv25.1.3) - 2026-01-26
### Deprecated
* - `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.createRBAC` is deprecated and no longer respected. In most cases, setting this field to `false` would result in a broken deployment. RBAC may be controlled via `rbac.enabled` or per controller via `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.{pvcUnbinder,brokerDecommissioner}.enabled`.
* `statefulset.sideCars.controllers.run` has been unused for many releases and is now deprecated. Individual controllers may be enabled/disabled by setting their enabled field: `statefulset.sideCars.pvcUnbinder.enabled`, `statefulset.sideCars.brokerDecommissioner.enabled`.
### Fixed
* Fix `CreateContainerConfigError: Error: container's runAsUser breaks non-root policy...` error with `statefulset.podTemplate.spec.securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true`

* In the 24.1.1 version Redpanda introduces new value `cloud_storage_credentials_source` for `cloud_storage_azure_managed_identity_id`
property. Redpanda helm chart schema validation rejected new value. Schema is extended to include new value.
