# pipeline.yml is the "entrypoint" for all BuildKite pipelines in the operator
# repo. As such, it is executed for ANY trigger (e.g. PR update/created, Tag
# updated/created, Schedule run). Use `if`s to delegate to specific pipeline
# from this file and try to adhere to the below rules.
#
# Do:
# - Use `gen` to generate pipeline files.
# - Use `if` to gate the execution of pipelines.
# - Include a human readable explanation of `if` gates.
# - Separate pipelines into distinct files and use `buildkite-agent pipeline upload`.
# - Chain together tasks (e.g. `task ci:setup ci:run-test ci:tear-down).
#
# Do not:
# - Use taskfile to gate execution of steps.
# - Have a pipeline serve multiple purposes.
steps:
  # ci-entry-point kicks off the complete operator test suite.
  # It is responsible for blocking or allowing GitHub PRs to be merged.
