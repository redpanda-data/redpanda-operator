## Unreleased
### Added
* Added support for casting to and from aliased struct types.

  ```go
  type MySpecialType SomeOtherStruct
  var x MySpecialType
  SomeOtherStruct(x)
  ```

## v1.1.0 - 2025-04-21
### Added
* Added support for `.Files.Get`, `.Files.GetBytes`, and `.Files.Lines`.
### Fixed
* Actually implement `fromYaml` (It was previously the same as `toYaml`).

  GoToHelm's implementation of `fromYaml` adds a wrapper around `fromYaml` that
  will `panic` if unmarshalling fails. This is done to avoid undefined behavior
  as helm's implementation returns an object containing the error; which can't
  be implemented in go in an ergonomic fashion.
