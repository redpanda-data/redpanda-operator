    desc: run Task within a docker image
    summary: |
      In scenarios where the host environment does not have the dependencies 
      expected by a task, the `docker:task` can be used to run it inside a 
      container. The goal for this is to behave exactly as if it was being 
      invoked on the host. For example:

        task docker:task \
          TASK_ARGS='rp:build COMPILER=gcc' \
          DOCKER_IMAGE=gcc:11

      is equivalent to:

        task rp:build COMPILER=gcc  # gcc-11 available on host

      When this task runs, the working directory ($PWD) is bind-mounted at the 
      same location as in the host, and some environment variables are defined 
      (see `cmds:` for the exact list).
    deps:
      - :dev:install-task
      - :dev:start-podman-socket-service
    run: always

          DOCKER_SOCKET=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock

        # there are two sets of environment variables that are defined:
        #
        #   1. those that come from the environment where `task` runs. these are
        #      defined prior to the execution of `task` and can be referenced in 
        #      `-e` and `--env-file` directly. there's no need to specify them 
        #      anywhere else
        #
        #   2. those that take their value from `task` variables. these need to 
        #      be declared in the `env:` part of this task, and then can be 
        #      referenced via `-e` flags. IMPORTANT: if the environment variable 
        #      being defined exists prior to `task` running, its value won't be 
        #      overridden (see https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/482)
