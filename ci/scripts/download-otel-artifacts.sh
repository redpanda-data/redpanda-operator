# This script requires having configured the bk CLI to use the redpanda organization and
# the token in the environment variable BUILDKITE_GRAPHQL_TOKEN. In addition to the above
# environment variable, it also requires the BASIC credentials for downloading artifacts
# from Buildkite as ARTIFACTS_DOWNLOAD_USER and ARTIFACTS_DOWNLOAD_PASSWORD.
# 
# It works in two modes, either passing $BRANCH $ARTIFACT_PREFIX or just $ARTIFACT_PREFIX
# to target the latest build on the current branch. All files are output to an artifacts
# directory.
# 
# The Buildkite token must have the GraphQL api enabled and requires the following scopes:
# - read_artifacts
# - read_builds
# - read_build_logs
# - read_organizations
# - read_pipelines
# - read_user
