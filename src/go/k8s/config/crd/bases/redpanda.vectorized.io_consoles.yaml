                                If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                referencing a part of an object.

                          pairs to your resources. Use labels to indicate different environments,
                          services, teams, and so on. Console may use additional labels for each secret.


                          Use a label with key "owner" to namespace secrets within a secret manager.
                          This label will always be set for the creation and listing of all secrets.
                          If you change the value after secrets have been created, Console will no
                          longer return them and consider them as managed by another application.
                          The owner label is optional but recommended.

                                SecretNamePrefixAppend is an optional string that shall be appended
                                to the global secretNamePrefix. This config is helpful if you want
                                to use a specific prefix for secrets belonging to this Kafka connect
                                cluster. You may want to do this if you want to restrict the
                                permissions for the kafka connect workers reading these secrets.


                                Example:
                                secretstore.secretNamePrefix is set to: "redpanda/prod/"
                                secretstore.kafkaConnect.clusters.dwh.secretNamePrefixAppend is set to: "dwh/"
                                => Secrets will be created with the prefix "redpanda/prod/dwh/" so that
                                you can apply special iam permissions in your cloud account.

                      SecretNamePrefix is the prefix that shall be used for each secret name
                      that will be stored. The prefix is used for namespacing your secrets,
                      so that one secret store can be used by multiple tenants.
                      For AWS it's common to use a path-like structure whereas GCP does not
                      allow slashes.


                      Examples:
                      AWS: redpanda/analytics/prod/console/
                      GCP: redpanda-analytics-prod-console-


                      Changing this prefix won't let you access secrets created under
                      a different prefix.
