# Helm charts for Redpanda

## Development

In each chart there is autogenerated `README.md` file. The template
is resides close to main file, but it has different file extension
(`gotmpl`). To update `README.md` please use
[`helm-docs`](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs). The manual
process of updating `README.md` is automated via
[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/).

Any manifest is synced manually between `operator/config` and
templates.
