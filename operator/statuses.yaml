# This file describes the unified cluster statuses generated for v1 and v2
# it's used by gen status to generate consistently typed structures for our errors.
# 
# It should remain heavily documented to demonstrate usage.
# 
# General usage:
# 
#    status := statuses.NewMyKind()
#    status.SetMyCondition(statues.MyKindMyConditionMyReason, "something happened!") // or don't pass any strings for reasons that have default messages
# 
#    // for server side applies you can do
#    kubernetes.ApplyPatch(config.WithStatus(mypackageac.SchemaStatus()
#      .WithConditions(status.StatusConditionConfigs(myKind)...)))
# 
#    // or for a standard update (internally this acts like apimeta.SetStatusCondition)
#    if status.UpdateConditions(myKind) { client.Update(...) }

# kind is the name of the status struct, here we'll generate a struct named "Cluster"
- kind: Cluster
  # appliesTo allows us to generate struct and field kubebuilder annotations to default our conditions in our API structs
  appliesTo:

  # description is the description to add for this struct as a doc comment

    Defines the observed status conditions of a cluster.
  # errors are reasons injected onto every status condition other than "final" or "rolled-up" conditions
  # both of which should be calculated *any* time a condition has changed due to being summaries of current
  # state.
  # 
  # Any error not marked "transient" is considered "terminal" in that setting one will cause any "final" conditions
  # to now be true rather than false. Use terminal errors when you know you don't want to reschedule reconciliation
  # and transient errors when you do.
  errors:
    - name: Error
      transient: true
      description: >
        This reason is used when a cluster has only been partially reconciled and we have early returned
        due to a retryable error occurring prior to applying the desired cluster state. It should only be
        set on the conditions currently in scope for the current cluster state, any subsequently derived
        conditions should use "StillReconciling".

      description: >
        This reason is used when a cluster has only been partially reconciled and we have early returned
        due to a known terminal error occurring prior to applying the desired cluster state. Any conditions
        not already derived should also receive the "TerminalError" reason. The cluster should also no longer
        be reconciled until it or an underlying resource is changed.

        This condition indicates whether a cluster is ready to serve any
        traffic. This can happen, for example if a cluster is partially degraded
        but still can process requests.

        This condition defaults to "Unknown" with a reason of "NotReconciled"
        and must be set by a controller when it subsequently reconciles a
        cluster.
      # reasons are the reasons associated with the condition.
      # 
      # The first reason in this list implictly becomes the "True" condition and should most
      # likely contain a default message that is unlikely to be overridden. For example:
      # 
      #   clusterStatus.SetReady(statuses.ClusterReadyReady)
      # 
      # Any subsequent reasons evaluate to "False" and should likely be used with context

      #   clusterStatus.SetReady(statuses.ClusterReadyNotReady, "resources not yet initially synced")
