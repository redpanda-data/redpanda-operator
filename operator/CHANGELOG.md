## v2.3.12-24.3.17 - 2025-07-08
### Changed
* The operator will try stripping off a layer of quotation from configuration values when interpreting numeric and boolean values. These may be accidentally introduced upstream of the CR, but where the intent is obvious we don't need to be strict about it.
### Fixed
* Added the missing `https` port to the operator Pod that was referenced by the [`ServiceMonitor`](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda-operator/blob/4e34c5ea79b00fa0caeda64955e3291666194274/operator/chart/servicemonitor.go#L42)
* Empty Redpanda specs (i.e. `clusterSpec: null` or otherwise unspecified) no longer causes the operator to panic
* `get` permissions on `Node` resources is now correctly configured by default.

   `--set rbac.createAdditionalControllerCRs=true` is no longer required for rackawareness to work.
* Crashes from the Sidecar container (e.g. due to a temporary API Server outage) no longer forcefully restart the redpanda container.

## v2.3.11-24.3.14 - 2025-05-27
### Changed
* Bump helm chart dependency to 5.9.23
* The v2 operator now uses a templated bootstrap.yaml file, like v1.

For the 2.3.* release only, the statefulset.initContainers.configurator.additionalCLIArgs entry on the CR is *not* populated by the operator; this must be done manually to resolve external secrets.
### Fixed
* updated operator v1 to ignore "cluster.redpanda.com/node-pool-spec" annotation for pod rolls. previously, under certain conditions, the operator started rolling pods if this annotation changed - but there is no need to do so.

## v2.3.10-24.3.14 - 2025-05-23
### Changed
* Bootstrap expansion in the v2 operator's initContainer now uses CEL-patching for its expansion, much like the v1 operator.

* It is not the case that the OperatorQuiescent condition for the v1 operator cannot be True unless the ClusterConfigured condition is also True.

The status.observedGeneration will only update when the cluster reaches the OperatorQuiescent state.
### Fixed
* Fields with embedded structs, such as `auth.sasl.bootstrapUser.secretKeyRef` and `listeners.internal.tls.truststore.configMapKeyRef`, are no longer discarded during rendering of resources.
* The operator now unconditionally produces statefulsets that have environment variables available to the initContainer that are used for CEL-based config patching.

Previously it attempted to leave existing sts resources unpatched if it seemed like they had already been bootstrapped. With the adoption of CEL patching for node configuration, that left sts pods unable to restart.
* The operator now unconditionally produces an environment for the initContainer that supports CEL-based patching.

This is required to ensure that a pre-existing sts can roll over to new configuration correctly.
* Improved support for multi-STSes (e.g., multiple NodePools) in the ghost broker decommissioning logic.

- Desired replicas were previously fetched from a single STS, leading to incorrect broker count decisions when multiple STSes were present. Now, the logic accounts for all STSes.
- Fixed incorrect broker map keying: previously used pod ordinal, which is not unique across STSes (e.g., `blue-0` and `green-0` both mapped to `0`). Switched to using the pod name as the key to correctly distinguish brokers.
- Disabled ordinal-based broker deletion logic in Operator v1 mode, as it doesn't work reliably in a multi-STS setup.

* Setting `serviceAccount.create` to `false` no longer prevents the Kubernetes ServiceAccountToken volume from being mounted to the operator Pod.

## v2.3.9-24.3.11 - 2025-05-02
### Added
* Added scheduled sync of ghost broker decommissioner to ensure it's running, even if no watches trigger the reconciler.
* v1 operator: ExternalSecretRefSelector is now provided for referring to external secrets in `clusterConfiguration`. This has an `optional` flag which is honoured if present - it turns errors into warnings if the secret can't be looked up.
* [Chart] Added `rbac.createCompatCRs` which intentionally over scopes the operator's RBAC configuration to preserve compatibility with redpanda charts <= v5.10.1 and <=v5.9.22.

  `rbac.createCompatCRs` defaults to `true` to prevent unexpected breakages upon upgrading the operator.
### Changed
* Reconciliation will attempt to create all resources regardless of errors encounter.
  All errors will be reported at the end of the reconciliation loop.

* [Chart] Moved all template rendering into `entry-point.yaml` to match the redpanda and console charts.
* The redpanda operator's helm chart has been merged into the operator itself.

  Going forward the chart's `version` and `appVersion` will always be equal.
* `rbac.createRPKBundleCRs` now defaults to `true`.
* Bumped internal chart version to v5.9.22
### Deprecated
* v1 operator: the `clusterConfiguration` field `ExternalSecretRef` is deprecated in favour of `ExternalSecretRefSelector`. Since this field was extremely new, it will be removed in the very near future.
### Fixed
* Reverse order of applying resources to first create ClusterRole and then ClusterRoleBinding.
  When Redpanda custom resource has enabled RBAC the reconciliation was blocked due
  ClusterRoleBinding referencing not yet created ClusterRole.

* Certificate reloading for webhook and metrics endpoints should now behave correctly.
* The operator will restart the redpanda cluster on any change to the cluster configuration
* Expanded the set of rules in both Roles and ClusterRoles to be appropriately in sync with the redpanda helm chart.
* DeprecatedFullNameOverride was interpreted differently between rendering resources and creating 
  kafka, admin and schema registry client. Now deprecated fullNameOverride will be used only
  if correct FullNameOverride is not provided and handled the same way for both
  client creation and render function.
* The Redpanda license was not set by operator. Now it will be set in the first reconciliation. After initial setup the consequent license re-set will be reconciled after client-go cache resync timeout (default 10h).
### Removed
* [CHART] The [`kube-prometheus-stack`](https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts) subchart has been removed.

  This integration was not being up kept and most use cases will be better served by deploying this chart themselves.

## v2.3.8-24.3.6 - 2025-03-05
### Fixed
* Fixed the way that paths are handled for the config watcher routine in the sidecar process.

## v2.3.7-24.3.6 - 2025-02-28
### Changed
* Bumped internal redpanda chart to  v5.9.20.
  `chartRef` now defaults to v5.9.20.
  When `useFlux` is `false`, the equivalent of chart v5.9.20 will be deployed.

### Removed
* `gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy` container is deprecated and has been removed from the Redpanda
operator helm chart. The same ports will continue to serve metrics using kubebuilder's built in RBAC.

Any existing prometheus rules don't need to be adjusted.

For more details see: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder/discussions/3907

### Fixed
* Usage of `tpl` and `include` now function as expected when `useFlux: false` is set.

  `{{ (get (fromJson (include "redpanda.Fullname" (dict "a" (list .)))) "r") }}` would previously failure with fairly arcane errors.

  Now, the above example will correctly render to a string value. However,
  syntax errors and the like are still reported in an arcane fashion.

* Toggling `useFlux`, in either direction, no longer causes the bootstrap user's password to be regenerated.

  Manual mitigation steps are available [here](https://github.com/redpanda-data/helm-charts/issues/1596#issuecomment-2628356953).


## v2.3.6-24.3.3 - 2025-01-17
### Added
* Users in air-gapped environments that cannot access the official Redpanda Helm Chart repository (`https://charts.redpanda.com/`)
  can now specify an alternative Helm chart repository using the `helm-repository-url` flag. In the Redpanda Operator Helm chart,
  this flag is not exposed as an option in the Helm values. Instead, it must be set as an input in the `additionalCmdFlags` array.
  
  The given repository must include the following charts:
  * Redpanda
  * Console
  * Connectors

* Added `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` as an alternative method of managing the redpanda container's resources.

  When both `resources.limits` and `resources.requests` are specified, the
  redpanda container's `resources` will be set to the provided values and all
  other keys of `resources` will be ignored. Instead, all other values will be
  inferred from the limits and requests.

  This allows fine grain control of resources. i.e. It is now possible to set
  CPU requests without setting limits:

  ```yaml
  resources:
    limits: {} # Specified but no cpu or memory values provided
    requests:
      cpu: 5 # Only CPU requests
  ```

### Changed
* For any user that is mirroring configurator image (air-gapped environment) and changes entrypoint
  or wraps configurator with additional script the following constraint need to be meet:
  * set the following flags
    * to change the container repository set `--configurator-base-image=my.repo.com/configurator` flag
    * to change the container tag set `--configurator-tag=XYZ` flag
  * image needs to supports the entrypoint `redpanda-operator configure` as it is the default one

### Fixed
* Value's merging no longer writes files to disk which prevents the operator from eating disk space when the reconciliation loop is run in rapid succession
* Fixed slice out of bounds panics when using the fs-validator and `useFlux: false`
