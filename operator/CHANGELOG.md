## Unreleased
### Added
* Users in air-gapped environments that cannot access the official Redpanda Helm Chart repository (`https://charts.redpanda.com/`)
  can now specify an alternative Helm chart repository using the `helm-repository-url` flag. In the Redpanda Operator Helm chart,
  this flag is not exposed as an option in the Helm values. Instead, it must be set as an input in the `additionalCmdFlags` array.
  
  The given repository must include the following charts:
  * Redpanda
  * Console
  * Connectors

### Changed
* For any user that is mirroring configurator image (air-gapped environment) and changes entrypoint
  or wraps configurator with additional script the following constraint need to be meet:
  * set the following flags
    * to change the container repository set `--configurator-base-image=my.repo.com/configurator` flag
    * to change the container tag set `--configurator-tag=XYZ` flag
  * image needs to supports the entrypoint `redpanda-operator configure` as it is the default one

### Fixed
* Value's merging no longer writes files to disk which prevents the operator from eating disk space when the reconciliation loop is run in rapid succession
* Fixed slice out of bounds panics when using the fs-validator and `useFlux: false`
