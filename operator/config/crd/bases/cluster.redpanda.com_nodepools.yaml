                        ValueSource is a generic "value" type that permits sourcing the actual
                        (runtime) value from a variety of sources.
                        In most cases, this should always output a CEL expression that's resolved at runtime.
                        Example use cases are:
                        - ClusterConfig e.g. Secret values
                        - NodeConfig e.g. Dynamic advertised_host
                        - RPKConfig e.g. Runtime resolved listing of broker addresses via SRV records.

                                  UID is a type that holds unique ID values, including UUIDs.  Because we
                                  don't ONLY use UUIDs, this is an alias to string.  Being a type captures
                                  intent and helps make sure that UIDs and names do not get conflated.

                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                provisioner.
                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
