                      IMPORTANT: Beta Feature

                      Setting the `useFlux` flag to `false` disables the Helm controller's reconciliation of the Helm chart.
                      This ties the operator to a specific version of the Go-based Redpanda Helm chart, causing all other
                      ChartRef fields to be ignored.

                      Before disabling `useFlux`, ensure that your `chartVersion` is aligned with `5.9.15` or the corresponding
                      version of the Redpanda chart.

                      Note: When `useFlux` is set to `false`, `RedpandaStatus` may become inaccurate if the HelmRelease is
                      manually deleted.

                      To dynamically switch Flux controllers (HelmRelease and HelmRepository), setting `useFlux` to `false`
                      will suspend these resources instead of removing them.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.

                      IMPORTANT: Beta Feature

                      Setting the `useFlux` flag to `false` disables the Helm controller's reconciliation of the Helm chart.
                      This ties the operator to a specific version of the Go-based Redpanda Helm chart, causing all other
                      ChartRef fields to be ignored.

                      Before disabling `useFlux`, ensure that your `chartVersion` is aligned with `5.9.15` or the corresponding
                      version of the Redpanda chart.

                      Note: When `useFlux` is set to `false`, `RedpandaStatus` may become inaccurate if the HelmRelease is
                      manually deleted.

                      To dynamically switch Flux controllers (HelmRelease and HelmRepository), setting `useFlux` to `false`
                      will suspend these resources instead of removing them.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                        Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                      procMount denotes the type of proc mount to use for the containers.
                                      The default is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for
                                      readonly paths and masked paths.
                                      This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be enabled.
