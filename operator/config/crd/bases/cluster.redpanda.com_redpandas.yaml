                      UseFlux flag set to `false` will prevent helm controller from reconciling helm chart. The operator would be
                      tight with `go` based Redpanda helm chart version. The rest of the ChartRef fields would be ignored.

                      Before setting UseFlux flag to `false` please align your ChartVersion to `5.9.15` or ``
                      version of the Redpanda chart.

                      RedpandaStatus might not be accurate if flag is set to `false` and HelmRelease is manually deleted.

                      To achieve dynamic switch for Flux controllers (HelmRelease and HelmRepository) the resources
                      would not be removed, but they will be put in suspended mode (if flag is provided and set to `false`).

                                              relates the key and values.

                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                            The same key is forbidden to exist in both matchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
