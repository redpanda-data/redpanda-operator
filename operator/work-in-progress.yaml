                  1. versioning is not supported for map keys

                  3. updating this map requires a manual restart of the Redpanda pods. Please be aware of
                  sync period when one Redpanda POD is restarted
                  4. cannot have keys that conflict with existing struct fields - it leads to panic

                                EndpointTemplate is a Golang template string that allows customizing each
                                broker advertised address.
                                Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                                default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                                provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                                computed from the template.
                                The following variables are available to the template:
                                - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                                - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                                Common template functions from Sprig (http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
                                are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                                functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                                EndpointTemplate is a Golang template string that allows customizing each
                                broker advertised address.
                                Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                                default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                                provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                                computed from the template.
                                The following variables are available to the template:
                                - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                                - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                                Common template functions from Sprig (http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
                                are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                                functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                                Subdomain can be used to change the behavior of an advertised
                                KafkaAPI. Each broker advertises Kafka API as follows

                                If Subdomain is empty then each broker advertises Kafka
                                API as PUBLIC_NODE_IP:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT.
                                If TLS is enabled then this subdomain will be requested

                                EndpointTemplate is a Golang template string that allows customizing each
                                broker advertised address.
                                Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                                default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                                provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                                computed from the template.
                                The following variables are available to the template:
                                - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                                - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                                Common template functions from Sprig (http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
                                are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                                functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                              EndpointTemplate is a Golang template string that allows customizing each
                              broker advertised address.
                              Redpanda uses the format BROKER_ID.SUBDOMAIN:EXTERNAL_KAFKA_API_PORT by
                              default for advertised addresses. When an EndpointTemplate is
                              provided, then the BROKER_ID part is replaced with the endpoint
                              computed from the template.
                              The following variables are available to the template:
                              - Index: the Redpanda broker progressive number
                              - HostIP: the ip address of the Node, as reported in pod status

                              Common template functions from Sprig (http://masterminds.github.io/sprig/)
                              are also available. The set of available functions is limited to hermetic
                              functions because template application needs to be deterministic.

                      restarts. The procedure can be described as follows:

                      1. Rolling update checks if Pod specification needs to be replaced and deletes it
                      2. Deleted Redpanda Pod is put into maintenance mode (postStart hook will disable
                         maintenance mode when new Pod starts)
                      3. Rolling update waits for Pod to be in Ready state
                      4. Rolling update checks if cluster is in healthy state
                      5. Rolling update checks if restarted Redpanda Pod admin API Ready endpoint returns HTTP 200 response
                      6. Using UnderReplicatedPartitionThreshold each under replicated partition metric is compared with the threshold
                      7. Rolling update moves to the next Redpanda pod

                      The metric `vectorized_cluster_partition_under_replicated_replicas` is used in the comparison

                      Mentioned metrics has the following help description:

                      By default, the UnderReplicatedPartitionThreshold will be 0, which means all partitions needs to catch up without any lag.

                          To use a KMS key in a different account, use the key ARN or the alias ARN.

                          If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager uses the key aws/secretsmanager.

                                SecretNamePrefixAppend is an optional string that shall be appended
                                to the global secretNamePrefix. This config is helpful if you want
                                to use a specific prefix for secrets belonging to this Kafka connect
                                cluster. You may want to do this if you want to restrict the
                                permissions for the kafka connect workers reading these secrets.

                                Example:
                                secretstore.secretNamePrefix is set to: "redpanda/prod/"
                                secretstore.kafkaConnect.clusters.dwh.secretNamePrefixAppend is set to: "dwh/"
                                => Secrets will be created with the prefix "redpanda/prod/dwh/" so that
                                you can apply special iam permissions in your cloud account.

                      SecretNamePrefix is the prefix that shall be used for each secret name
                      that will be stored. The prefix is used for namespacing your secrets,
                      so that one secret store can be used by multiple tenants.
                      For AWS it's common to use a path-like structure whereas GCP does not
                      allow slashes.

                      Examples:
                      AWS: redpanda/analytics/prod/console/
                      GCP: redpanda-analytics-prod-console-

                      Changing this prefix won't let you access secrets created under
                      a different prefix.

                      tight with `go` based Redpanda helm chart version. The rest of the ChartRef fields would be ignored.

                      Before setting UseFlux flag to `false` please align your ChartVersion to `5.9.15` or ``
                      version of the Redpanda chart.

                      RedpandaStatus might not be accurate if flag is set to `false` and HelmRelease is manually deleted.

                                        MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.

                                        be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                        incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                        to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                        for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                        pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                        The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                        Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
                                        This is an alpha field and requires enabling MatchLabelKeysInPodAffinity feature gate.

                                      The default is DefaultProcMount which uses the container runtime defaults for
                                      readonly paths and masked paths.
                                      This requires the ProcMountType feature flag to be enabled.
