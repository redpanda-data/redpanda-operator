# Harpoon

Tools to kill a `kuttl`(fish).

## Description

Harpoon is a set of BDD lifecycle and Kubernetes helper wrappers around [github.com/cucumber/godog](https://github.com/cucumber/godog).

## Extensions

### Lifecycle Hooks

Stock `godog` explicitly [removed](https://github.com/cucumber/godog/issues/335) support for any sort of feature-based hooking of their test suite steps. This makes it very difficult to have a "medium" level of isolation where some expensive to provision component is shared between features, but isolated from the rest of the suite.

Currently the only way of adding in feature-based hooking is to hook into a `formatters` interface implementation that gets called when a new feature is started and reference counting the number of scenarios that will be run, and then detecting when all of those features finish.

### Testing Cleanup

The way that `godog` passes access to `testing.T` is weird. It passes an optional `context.Context` to every test step and you can pull a `testing.T`-like interface from the context using `godog.T(ctx)`. Unfortunately this interface doesn't have any sort of "lifecyle" helpers. Namely it doesn't expose a `Cleanup` method. This library wraps `godog.TestingT` with a cleanup manager that allows you to call teardown code on a per-scenario or per-feature basis.

### Tags

This library (ab)uses Gherkin tags for a couple of purposes:

1. Test selection based on the concept of providers. This allows you to specify which tests run/do not run on a per-environment basis. If some features are not yet supported, or at least not yet tested on say an EKS environment, you can skip those tests when specifying a test run via `-provider eks`. This is accomplished by looking for tags in the format of `@skip:provider-name`.
2. Shortcut test setup/teardown. This is, in part, tied to the shortcoming of `godog` in providing a mechanism for feature-level hooking. If you want to specify a feature-level before hook in `godog` you must implement it as a `Background` clause that has a singleton guard using something like `sync.Once` due to the fact that `Background` is implemented by just copying an additional step into the `Scenario` block. Rather than implementing a singleton, you can add a "tag" processor that allows you to do some sort of setup/teardown logic based on a tag (i.e. apply and delete some manifest with a given name via implementing a processer to handle `manifest:name`). Additionally, these tag processors allow you to inject additional state into context that can be fetched per test.

### Kubernetes Helpers

Because this is already substantially extending the footprint of `TestingT` and wrapping it in a new interface that adds lifecycle support, this interface also adds some useful helpers attached to the `TestingT` interface, namely:

1. The ability to install a helm chart
2. The ability to apply and delete manifests
3. Embedding an initialized controller-runtime client

Additionally, because the full suite setup of any Kubernetes operator generally has some typical steps, i.e. setting up dependencies. There are some top-level hooks exposed as a suite builder pattern that allows you to do things such as install CRDs or helm charts during suite initialization.

### Feature Provider Table Generation

Because of the tagging extensions above that allow you to skip tests on a per-provider basis, the `tablegenerator` package in this library implements a simple markdown-based table generator for documentation to show which features are supported by what providers. Its rendered output looks like this:

|      SCENARIO      | EKS | AKS | GKE | K3D |
|--------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Some scenario      | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  | ✅  |

### Normalized flag utilization

Check `suite.go` for all flags, but some highlights:

- `-retain`: Skip cleanup phase for tests which failed
- `-timeout`: Set the timeout for the entire test suite to run
- `-provider`: Specify a provider with its own unique hooks and scenarios to run

## Usage

Included is a "stub" test suite example, but here's a slightly more complex suite builder setup:

```go
	suite, err = framework.SuiteBuilderFromFlags().
		RegisterProvider("eks", framework.NoopProvider).
		RegisterProvider("gke", framework.NoopProvider).
		RegisterProvider("aks", framework.NoopProvider).
		RegisterProvider("k3d", framework.NoopProvider).
		WithDefaultProvider("k3d").
		WithHelmChart("http://some.host.local", "some", "dependency", helm.InstallOptions{
			Name:            "dependency",
			Namespace:       "dependency",
			Version:         "v1.1.1",
			CreateNamespace: true,
		}).
		WithCRDDirectory("path/to/crds").
=		OnFeature(func(ctx context.Context, t framework.TestingT) {
			t.Log("Installing some helm chart")
			t.InstallHelmChart(ctx, "http://some.host.local", "some", "chart", helm.InstallOptions{
				Name:      "chart",
				Namespace: t.IsolateNamespace(ctx),
				Values: map[string]any{},
			})
			t.Log("Successfully installed some helm chart")
		}).
		RegisterTag("mytag", 1, MyTagProcessor).
		Build()
```
